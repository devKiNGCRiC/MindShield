## 🎯 About

**MindShield** is an MCA student project that transforms academic learning into real-world impact. Unlike passive screen time trackers that merely observe your habits, MindShield creates genuine accountability through financial commitment.

### The Core Concept

Users stake **₹200-₹2000** on their ability to stay focused for **1-8 hours**. Success means they get their money back plus rewards. Failure means:
- **52%** goes to RKC_BHARAT charity (education, healthcare, rural development)
- **28%** funds app development and operations
- **20%** covers payment processing fees

**Psychology:** Loss aversion is 2.5x stronger than gain motivation. When real money is on the line, focus becomes natural.

## 🔥 The Problem

### The Phone Addiction Crisis

- **144** times per day: Average person checks phone
- **3-4 hours** daily: Time spent on smartphones
- **71%** of people sleep with or next to their phones
- **89%** of students experience phantom vibration syndrome
- **Billions** lost annually in productivity worldwide

### Why Existing Solutions Fail

| Solution | Limitation | Success Rate |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Screen time trackers | Show data, don't enforce change | 15% |
| App blockers | Easy to disable when tempted | 20% |
| Gamified focus apps | No real consequences | 30% |
| Willpower alone | Fades quickly | 8% |
| **MindShield** | **Financial stakes + social good** | **Target: 60%+** |
