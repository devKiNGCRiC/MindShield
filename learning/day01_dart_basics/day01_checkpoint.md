## üéØ ANSWER KEY

<details>
<summary><b>Click to reveal answers (Try the quiz first!)</b></summary>

### Section 1: Variables & Data Types
1.1: **B** or **D** (Both are correct! `final` for runtime, `const` for compile-time)  
1.2: **B** (String stores text)  
1.3: **B** (`final` is set at runtime, `const` at compile-time)  
1.4: **B** (The `??` operator returns 100 because value is null)  
1.5: **D** (All are valid ways to declare a list)

### Section 2: Operators
2.1: **A** (15 divided by 4 has remainder 3)  
2.2: **B** (Integer division gives only whole number)  
2.3: **A** (500 is between 200 and 2000, so true)  
2.4: **B** (10+5=15, then 15√ó2=30)  
2.5: **B** (17 is not >= 18, so 'Minor')

### Section 3: Control Flow
3.1: **B** (i goes from 0 to 4, that's 5 times)  
3.2: **B** (`do-while` always executes code block at least once)  
3.3: **B** (`break` exits the loop completely)  
3.4: **C** (75 >= 70 is the first true condition)  
3.5: **B** (`switch` is cleaner for multiple specific value comparisons)

### Challenge 4.1: FizzBuzz Solution
```dart
for (int i = 1; i <= 15; i++) {
  if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
    print('FizzBuzz');
  } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
    print('Fizz');
  } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
    print('Buzz');
  } else {
    print(i);
  }
}
```

### Challenge 4.2: Stake Validator Solution
```dart
bool validateStake(int stake) {
  return stake >= 200 && stake <= 2000;
}

// Usage:
print(validateStake(500));  // true
print(validateStake(100));  // false
```
